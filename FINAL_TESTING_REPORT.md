## Detailed Component Coverage

This section shows the current coverage status of different component types in the application.

## Tools and Scripts

The testing infrastructure includes several useful scripts:

1. **Test Template Generator**
   `node scripts/generate-test-template.js <type> <filename>`
   Generates complete test templates for any component.

2. **Component Test Generator**
   `node scripts/generate-component-tests.js <component-type> <component-name>`
   Simplified interface for generating tests for specific components.

3. **Auto Test Report**
   `npm run test:report` or `node scripts/auto-test-report.js`
   Runs all tests and automatically updates this report.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing tests for the remaining components
2. Run tests regularly to maintain code quality
3. Monitor coverage progress toward 100% goal
4. Update documentation as tests are added
