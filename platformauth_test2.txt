A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been 
force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to 
improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to 
find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that 
.unref() was called on them.

Force exiting Jest: Have you considered using 
`--detectOpenHandles` to detect async operations that kept 
running after all tests finished?
